1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 238 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?
Friends per candidate:
DrJillStein 1642
GovGaryJohnson 3511
HillaryClinton 784
realDonaldTrump 45
each candidate follows a person due to some or other reason and they could have similar interest or totally different reasons. 
The common friends count of DrJillStein and GovGaryJohnson is 236 and common friends count of HillaryClinton and 
realDonaldTrump is 2. Also the number of people realDonaldTrump is significantly less than other candidates.Also gary follows almost
3k people and jillstein follows almost 2k people. Here also the difference is of almost 1k which is quite significant and same goes for 
Hillary clinton and donald trump. Hence we can conclude that each person behaviour is quite different. so we can not say that Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are
more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
We can fix this problem by studying there behaviour patterns and we can do that by applying machine learning algorithms.








2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.

User followed by Hillary and Donald: ['VP', 'WhiteHouse']
The above are the two twitter IDs that both Hillary and Donald follows. @Whitehouse is the official Id of The white house 
and the reason both these candidates follow is that this ID provides news about the latest decison that trump administration is taking and 
also provide news about other major decision that are happening and how it will shape their country. @VP is the official Id of the the vice president 
and Donald trump is the president and this could be the reason that he follows this account and hilary ran for president post and hence it could be one 
of the reason that she follows this account.









3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?

There could be many reasons as to why trump follows so less users and why other candidates follow more number of people.
If we look into the friends of the trump, trump follows most of his family members and his administration staff and if we look into the friends of 
any other candiddates they follow people outside there interest as well. One reason could be popularity. Now when trump ran for elections he was most famous and favoured at that time.
and was able to influence the people and more over the people he follows are his family members and the persons who run his business and this tell us that trump is self centred 
and this may be the reason why he follows so less number of people. .
Yes it will affect our analysis as the variation is quite different in all the four cases. There are two candidates whose numbers are quite high and then there are two whose number 
is quite low so if we try to plot a graph, the graph for gary and DrJillStein will be dense and for other two will not be dense. So we learn from this that no two persons are similar.








4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?

Common friends = 5712
and now we have 4 candidates
total number of users = 5712+4 5716
rate limit is of 15 minutes
5716/15 = 381.06
We can say that total time would be 381*15+1=5716 minutes
